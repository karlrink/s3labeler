support simple form post...

trying to get HTTP PATCH working with javascript fetch(url, {mode:'CORS',method:"PATCH", headers: {}} but seems to resort back to GET?

interesting that jQuery works...  but i don't want to download full jQuery library...  i just want javascript to work...


need to add POST method...  now have to decide on vals and how i want api...    

POST  /s3/<s3bucket>/<s3object>
{label:value}
and/or
POST  /post
{s3object:s3object, label:value}
